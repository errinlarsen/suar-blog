title: Installing the server - part 1
date: 2011-12-30

## Rackspace
I created an account with [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) and started up the smallest server they offer.  The technical details are:

             RAM:  256 MB
      Disk Space:  10 GB
    Distribution:  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid)

I named this server *app1*.  This should cost me about $11 a month.

## Namecheap.com
I proceeded to create an account with [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com) to host my domain.  I transferred the domain I already owned (irkeninvader.com) from GoDaddy to Namecheap following their directions.  It was (relatively) painless and was all the way complete after about 24 hours.

Once the domain was all the way transferred, I set up the DNS to point to the Rackspace instance I created.  This means that www.irkeninvader.com now resolves to my new server!

## Server configuration
Next up is configuring the new server ...
